Psychologists do study people, but they study animals as well. And to better understand what motivates behavior, psychologists study not only what people and animals do but also what happens in their bodies and in their brains as they do it. The study of psychology is not important only to psychologists: psychology is a <i>hub science</i> and findings from psychological research are cited and used in many other fields as diverse as cancer research, health, and even climate change (<a class="biblioref" href="bm04_pg0001.xhtml#P70010120780000000000000000080FB">Cacioppo, 2013</a>; <a class="biblioref" href="bm04_pg0001.xhtml#P7001012078000000000000000008BA5">McDonald et al., 2015</a>; <a class="biblioref" href="bm04_pg0001.xhtml#P7001012078000000000000000008F17">Roberto &amp; Kawachi, 2014</a>; <a class="biblioref" href="bm04_pg0001.xhtml#P7001012078000000000000000008F6F">Rothman et al., 2015</a>; <a class="biblioref" href="bm04_pg0001.xhtml#P70010120780000000000000000092B9">van der Linden et al., 2015</a>).

The term <i>mental processes</i> refers to all the internal, covert (hidden) activity of our minds, such as thinking, feeling, and remembering. Why “scientific”? To study behavior and mental processes in both animals and humans, researchers must observe them. Whenever a human being observes anyone or anything, there’s always a possibility that the observer will see only what he or she <i>expects</i> to see. Psychologists don’t want to let these possible biases<a class="noteref noteref_footnote" epub:type="noteref" href="#biases"><i class="icon-info-sign info"></i><span class="reader-only">more info</span></a> cause them to make faulty observations. They want to be precise and to measure as carefully as they can—so they use a systematic<a class="noteref noteref_footnote" epub:type="noteref" href="#systematic"><i class="icon-info-sign info"></i><span class="reader-only">more info</span></a> approach to study psychology scientifically.</p>

It’s not that no one thought about why people and animals do the things they do before then; on the contrary, there were philosophers,<a class="noteref noteref_footnote" epub:type="noteref" href="#philosophers"><i class="icon-info-sign info"></i><span class="reader-only">more info</span></a> medical doctors, and physiologists<a class="noteref noteref_footnote" epub:type="noteref" href="#physiologists"><i class="icon-info-sign info"></i><span class="reader-only">more info</span></a> who thought about little else—particularly with regard to people.

Philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, and Descartes tried to understand or explain the human mind and its connection to the physical body (<a class="biblioref" href="bm04_pg0001.xhtml#P700101207800000000000000000839B">Durrant, 1993</a>; <a class="biblioref" href="bm04_pg0001.xhtml#P7001012078000000000000000008443">Everson, 1995</a>; <a class="biblioref" href="bm04_pg0001.xhtml#P70010120780000000000000000088DD">Kenny, 1968</a>, <a class="biblioref" href="bm04_pg0001.xhtml#P70010120780000000000000000088DF">1994</a>). Medical doctors and physiologists wondered about the physical connection between the body and the brain. For example, physician and physicist Gustav Fechner is often credited with performing some of the first scientific experiments that would form a basis for experimentation in psychology with his studies of perception (<a class="biblioref" href="bm04_pg0001.xhtml#P7001012078000000000000000008467">Fechner, 1860</a>), and physician Hermann von Helmholtz (<a class="biblioref" href="bm04_pg0001.xhtml#P70010120780000000000000000092E7">von Helmholtz, 1852</a>, <a class="biblioref" href="bm04_pg0001.xhtml#P70010120780000000000000000092E9">1863</a>) performed groundbreaking experiments in visual and auditory perception.

			<p>It was a normal exercise session for Jerome Yanger. Up at 5:30 AM, he climbed onto his exercise bike and began vigorously peddling, hoping to meet, and exceed, his average speed of 14 miles per hour. Stationed in front of the television, he used the remote control to tune to the morning business news. Occasionally glancing up at the television, he began reading a report he had begun the night before, silently cursing at some of the poor sales figures he was seeing. By the time his half-hour of exercise was over, he had finished the report, signed a few letters his administrative assistant had typed for him, and left two voice-mail messages for some colleagues.</p>
		</aside>
		<p>Most of us would be ready for a nap after such a packed half hour. For Jerome Yanger, however, it was routine: He always tried to multitask, thinking it more efficient. Developmentalists might see it as symptomatic of a behavior style that puts Jerome at risk for coronary heart disease.</p>

		<p>Health concerns become increasingly important to people in middle age. Surveys asking what worries adults show health—as well as safety and money—to be an issue of concern. More than half of adults say they are either “afraid” or “very afraid” of having cancer (see <a class="xref" href="#figure8-3"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">8-3</span></a>).</p>

		<p>For most people, however, midlife is a period of health. According to census figures, the vast majority of middle-aged adults report no chronic health difficulties and face no limitations on their activities.</p>
		<p>In fact, in some ways health is better in middle adulthood than in earlier periods of life. People ages 45 to 65 are less likely than younger adults to experience infections, allergies, respiratory diseases, and digestive problems. They may contract fewer of these diseases now because they have already experienced them and built up immunities (Sterns, Barrett, &amp; Alexander, 1985).</p>
		<p>Certain chronic diseases do begin to appear in middle adulthood. Arthritis typically begins after age 40, and diabetes is most likely to occur between ages 50 and 60, particularly in those who are overweight. Hypertension (high blood pressure) is one of the most frequent chronic disorders. Often called the “silent killer” because it is symptomless, hypertension, if left untreated, greatly increases the risk of strokes and heart disease. For such reasons, a variety of preventive and diagnostic medical tests are routinely recommended for adults during middle adulthood (Walters &amp; Rye, 2009) (see <a class="xref" href="#table8-1"><span class="label">Table</span> <span class="number">8-1</span></a>).</p>

		<p>The onset of chronic diseases in middle age boosts the death rate above that of earlier periods. Still, death remains rare: Only three out of every hundred 40-year-olds are expected to die before age 50, and eight out of every hundred 50-year-olds are expected to die before age 60. And the death rate for people between 40 and 60 has declined dramatically over the past 50 years. It now stands at just half of what it was in the 1940s. There also are cultural variations in health, as we consider next (Smedley &amp; Syme, 2000).</p>

			<h1 class="title">Stress in Middle Adulthood</h1>
		</header>
		<p>Stress continues to have a significant impact on health, as it did in young adulthood, although the stressors may have changed. For example, parents may worry about their adolescent child’s potential drug use rather than whether their toddler is ready to give up his pacifier.</p>
		<p>No matter what events trigger stress, the results are similar. <span class="emphasis">Psychoneuroimmunologists</span>, who study the relationship between the brain, the immune system, and psychological factors, report that stress has three main consequences, summarized in <a class="xref" href="#figure8-4"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number"> 8-4</span></a>. First, stress has direct physiological effects, ranging from increased blood pressure and hormonal activity to decreased immune system response. Second, stress leads people to engage in unhealthy behaviors, such as cutting back on sleep, smoking, drinking, or taking other drugs. Finally, stress has indirect effects on health-related behavior. People under a lot of stress may be less likely to seek out good medical care, exercise, or to comply with medical advice. All of these can lead to or affect serious health conditions, including heart disease (Dagher et al., 2009; Ihle et al., 2012; Emery, Anderson, &amp; Goodwin, 2013).</p>

					<h1 class="title">Individual Variation in Health: Ethnic and Gender Differences</h1>
				</header>
				<p>Overall figures for the health of middle-aged adults mask vast individual differences. While most people are healthy, some are beset by a variety of ailments. Genetics play a role. For instance, hypertension often runs in families.</p>
				<p>Social and environmental factors also affect health. For ­instance, the death rate for middle-aged African Americans in the United States is twice the rate for Caucasians. Why should this be true?</p>
				<p>Socioeconomic status (SES) is a significant factor. For whites and African Americans of the same SES level, the death rate for African Americans is actually lower than for whites. Members of lower-income families, however, are more likely to experience a disabling illness. There are many reasons for this. People in lower-SES households are more apt to work in dangerous occupations, such as mining or construction work. Lower-income people also often have inferior health care coverage. The crime rates and environmental pollutants are generally higher in lower-income neighborhoods. A higher incidence of accidents and health hazards, and thus a higher death rate, are linked to lower levels of income (Fingerhut &amp;  Makuc, 1992; Dahl &amp; Birkelund, 1997; Hendren, Humiston, &amp;  Fiscella, 2012).</p>
				<p>Gender also makes a difference. Women’s overall mortality rate is lower than men’s—a trend that holds true from birth—but the incidence of illness among midlife women is higher than for men.</p>
				<p>Women are more susceptible to minor, short-term illness and chronic, but non-life-threatening diseases such as migraine headaches, while men are more susceptible to serious illnesses such as heart disease. Fewer women smoke than men, which reduces their risk for cancer and heart disease; women drink less alcohol than men, which lowers the incidence of cirrhosis of the liver and auto accidents; and they work at less dangerous jobs (McDonald, 1999).</p>
				<p>Another reason for the higher rate of illness in women may be that more medical research targets men and the disorders they suffer. The vast majority of medical research money goes to preventing life-threatening diseases faced mostly by men, rather than to chronic conditions such as heart disease that may cause disability and suffering, but not necessarily death. Typically, research on diseases that strike both men and women focuses on men as subjects rather than women. This bias is now being addressed in initiatives by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, but the historical pattern has been one of gender discrimination by a male-dominated research community (Vidaver et al., 2000).</p>

			<h1 class="title">The A’s and B’s of Coronary Heart Disease:  Linking Health and Personality</h1>
		</header>
		<p>More men die in middle age from diseases relating to the heart and circulatory system than from any other cause. Women are less vulnerable, as we’ll see, but they are not immune. Each year such diseases kill around 151,000 people under the age of 65, and they are responsible for more loss of work and disability days due to hospitalization than any other cause (American Heart Association, 2010).</p>
		<p><span class="leadin">Risk Factors for Heart Disease.</span> Although heart and circulatory diseases are a major problem, some people have a much lower risk than others. The death rate in some countries, such as Japan, is only a quarter of the rate in the United States. A few other countries have a considerably higher death rate. Why?</p>
		<p>The answer is both genetics and environment. Some people seem genetically predisposed to heart disease. If a person’s parents suffered from it, the likelihood is greater that she or he will too. Similarly, sex and age are risk factors: Men are more likely to suffer from heart disease, and the risk rises as people age.</p>
		<p>Environment and lifestyle choices are also important. Cigarette smoking, a diet high in fats and cholesterol, and a lack of physical exercise all increase the risk of heart disease. Such factors may explain country-to-country variations in the rate of heart disease. For example, the death rate from heart disease in Japan is relatively low and may be due to differences in diet: The typical Japanese diet is much lower in fat than it is in the United States (Wilcox, Castro, &amp; King 2006; De Meersman &amp; Stein, 2007; Scarbourough et al., 2012).</p>
		<p>Diet is not the only factor. Psychological factors—particularly how stress is perceived and experienced—appear to be related to heart disease. For instance, a set of personality characteristics, known as Type A behavior, appears to be a factor in the development of coronary heart disease.</p>
		<p>The <span class="emphasis">Type A behavior pattern</span> is characterized by competitiveness, impatience, and a tendency toward frustration and hostility. Type A people are extremely ambitious and they engage in <span class="emphasis">polyphasic activities</span>—multiple activities carried out simultaneously. They are the true multitaskers whom you see talking on their phones while working on their laptop computers while riding the commuter train—and eating breakfast. Easily angered, they become both verbally and nonverbally hostile if prevented from reaching their goals.</p>
		<p>In contrast, many people have virtually the opposite characteristics in what is known as the Type B behavior pattern. The <span class="emphasis">Type B behavior pattern</span> is characterized by noncompetitiveness, patience, and a lack of aggression. In contrast to Type A’s, Type B’s experience little sense of time urgency, and they are rarely hostile.</p>
		<p>Type A and Type B behavior is significant because the distinction is related to the risk of coronary heart disease. Type A men have twice the rate of coronary heart disease, a greater number of fatal heart attacks, and five times as many heart problems as Type B men (Strube, 1990; Wielgosz &amp; Nolan, 2000).</p>
		<figure class="informalfigure">
			<img src="{{path}}/images/epub/AAFOGFU0.jpg" alt="Photo shows a woman in a business suit sitting in front of a computer, talking over the phone while browsing through her diary." />
			<figcaption>
				<div class="caption">
					<p>In addition to being characterized as competitive, people with Type A personalities also tend to engage in polyphasic activities, or doing a number of things at once. Does a Type A personality deal with stress differently from a Type B personality?</p>
				</div>
			</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>It’s important to note that some critics believe that the evidence for the existence of Type A and Type B behavior patterns is questionable. Moreover, some evidence suggests that only certain components of Type A behavior are most involved in producing disease, and not the entire constellation of behaviors associated with the pattern. Specifically, it seems as if the hostility and anger components of Type A behavior are the central link to coronary heart disease (Demaree &amp; Everhart, 2004; Eaker et al., 2004; Kahn, 2004; Myrtek, 2007).</p>
		<p>Although the relationship between at least some Type A behaviors and heart disease is relatively clear, this does not mean that all middle-aged adults who can be characterized as Type A’s are destined to suffer from coronary heart disease. Other types of negative emotions besides the hostility found in Type A behavior have been linked to heart disease. For example, psychologist Johan Denollet has identified behavior he calls
			<span class="emphasis">Type D</span>—for  “distressed”—that is linked to coronary heart disease. He believes that insecurity, anxiety, and having a negative outlook put people at risk for heart attacks (Pedersen et al., 2009; Mols &amp;  Denollet, 2010; Kupper et al., 2013).
		</p>
		<header>
			<h1 class="title">The Threat of Cancer</h1>
		</header>
		<p>Few diseases are as frightening as cancer, and many middle-aged adults view a cancer diagnosis as a death sentence. Although the reality is different—many forms of cancer respond well to medical treatment, and 40 percent of those diagnosed are still alive 5 years later—the disease raises many fears. And there is no denying that cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States (Smedley &amp; Syme, 2000).</p>
		<p>The precise trigger for cancer is still not known, but the process by which it spreads is clear. Certain cells in the body begin to multiply rapidly and uncontrollably. As they increase in number, these cells form tumors. Unimpeded, they draw nutrients from healthy cells and body tissue. Eventually, they destroy the body’s ability to function.</p>
		<p>Like heart disease, cancer is associated with a variety of genetic and environmental risk factors. Some cancers have clear genetic components. For example, a family history of breast cancer—the most common cause of cancer death among women—raises the risk for a woman.</p>
		<p>Several environmental and behavioral factors are also related to the risk of cancer. Poor nutrition, smoking, alcohol use, exposure to sunlight, exposure to radiation, and particular occupational hazards (such as exposure to certain chemicals or asbestos) are all known to increase the chances of developing cancer.</p>
		<p>After a diagnosis, several forms of treatment are possible, depending on the type of cancer. One treatment is
			<span class="emphasis">radiation therapy</span>, in which radiation targets the tumor in an attempt to destroy it. Patients undergoing
			<span class="emphasis">chemotherapy</span> ingest controlled doses of toxic substances meant to poison the tumor. Finally, surgery is used to remove the tumor (and often the surrounding tissue). The form of treatment is determined by how far the cancer has spread when it is first identified.
		</p>
		<p>Because early detection improves a patient’s chances, diagnostic techniques that help identify the first signs of cancer are of great importance. This is especially true in middle adulthood, when the risk of certain cancers increases.</p>
		<p>
			<span>Physicians urge that women do routine breast exams and men regularly check their testicles for signs of cancer. Cancer of the prostate gland, the most common type of cancer in men, can be detected by routine rectal exams and by a blood test that identifies prostate-specific antigen (PSA).</span>

		<p>Mammograms provide internal scans of women’s breasts to help identify early-stage cancer. However, at what age women should begin to routinely have the procedure has been controversial.</p>
		<header>
			<h1 class="title">Routine Mammograms: At What Age Should Women Start?</h1>
		</header>
		<aside class="vignette">
			<p>Life had been totally on track for Kristy Cajulo. She ate well, exercised routinely, and her most serious illness had been the flu a year back. So when she carried out a routine breast examination on the day of her 36th birthday and found a small lump, she was surprised, but assumed it was nothing. But the bigger shock was to come after her physician had the lump biopsied and learned she had early-stage breast cancer.</p>
		</aside>
		<p>In many ways, Linda was lucky: She found her cancer early. Statistically, the earlier breast cancer is diagnosed, the better a woman’s chances of survival. But just how to accomplish early identification has produced some degree of contention in the medical field. In particular, controversy surrounds the age at which
			<span class="emphasis">mammograms</span>, a kind of weak x-ray used to examine breast tissue, should be routinely administered to women.
		</p>
		<p>Mammograms are among the best means of detecting breast cancer in its earliest stages. The technique allows physicians to identify tumors while they are still very small. Patients have time for treatment before the tumor grows and spreads to other parts of the body. Mammograms have the potential for saving many lives, and nearly all medical professionals suggest that at some point during middle adulthood women should routinely obtain them.</p>
		<p>But at what age should women start having annual mammograms? The risk of breast cancer begins to grow at around the age of 30 and then becomes increasingly more likely. Ninety-five percent of new cases occur in women aged 40 and above (SEER, 2005).</p>
		<p>Determining the age to begin routine screening mammograms is complicated by two considerations. First, there is the problem of
			<span class="emphasis">false positives</span>, instances in which the test suggests something is wrong when in fact there is no problem. Because the breast tissue of younger women is denser than that of older women, younger women are more likely to have false positives. In fact, some estimates suggest that as many as a third of all younger women who have repeated mammograms are likely to have a false positive that necessitates further testing or a biopsy. Furthermore, the opposite problem also may occur:
			<span class="emphasis">false negatives</span>, in which a mammogram does not detect indications of cancer (Destounis et al., 2009; Elmore et al., 2009; Armstrong et al., 2013).

		<p>In what proved to be a controversial proposal, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a panel appointed by the government, recommended in 2009 that women in their 40s should
			<span class="emphasis">not</span> routinely have mammograms, and that women between the ages of 50 and 74 should have mammograms every 2 years, rather than annually. Their recommendation was based on a cost-benefit analysis showing that the risks of mammograms could be cut in half while still offering 80 percent of the benefits of annual mammograms (Nelson  et al., 2009).
		</p>
		<p>Their recommendation was immediately criticized by several major women’s groups, along with the American Cancer Society and American College of Radiology. They argued that women aged 40 and above should receive annual screenings (Grady, 2009).</p>
		<p>Ultimately, the determination of the timing of screenings is a highly personal one. Women should consult their health care providers and discuss the latest research regarding the frequency of mammograms. And for certain women, who have a history of breast cancer in their families or a mutation in a gene called BRCA, the evidence is clear that mammograms starting at age 40 are beneficial (Grady, 2009; Alonso et al., 2012; Smith, Duffy, &amp; Tabar, 2012).</p>

			<p>It began innocently enough. Forty-five-year-old Bina Clingman couldn’t remember whether she had mailed the letter that her husband had given her, and she wondered, briefly, whether this was a sign of aging. The next day, the question recurred when she spent 20 minutes looking for a phone number she knew she had written down on a piece of paper—somewhere. By the time she found it, she was surprised and even a little anxious. “Am I losing my memory?” she asked herself, feeling both annoyance and a degree of concern.</p>

		<p>Many people in their 40s feel more absentminded than they did 20 years earlier, and they have some concern about becoming less mentally able as they age. Common wisdom suggests that people lose some mental sharpness in midlife. But how accurate is this notion?</p>

			<h1 class="title">Does Intelligence Decline in Adulthood?</h1>
		</header>
		<p>For years, experts provided an unwavering response when asked whether intelligence declined in adulthood: Intelligence peaks at age 18, stays fairly steady until the mid-20s, and then gradually declines until the end of life.</p>
		<p>Today, developmentalists view questions about changes in intelligence across the life span as more complicated—and they have come to different, and more complex, conclusions.</p>
		<p><span class="leadin">The Difficulties in Answering the Question.</span> The conclusion that intelligence starts to diminish in the mid-20s was based on extensive research. <span class="emphasis">Cross-sectional studies</span>—which test people of different ages at the same point in time—clearly showed that older subjects were less likely to score well than younger subjects on traditional intelligence tests of the sort we discussed earlier.</p>
		<p>But consider the drawbacks of cross-sectional research—in particular, the possibility that it may suffer from <span class="emphasis">cohort effects</span>. Recall that cohort effects are influences associated with growing up at a particular historical time that affect persons of a particular age. For instance, suppose that compared to younger subjects, the older people in a cross-sectional study had had less adequate educations, less stimulating jobs, or were less healthy. In that case, the lower IQ scores of the older group could not be attributed solely, or perhaps even partially, to differences in intelligence based on age. Because they do not control for cohort effects, cross-sectional studies may well <span class="emphasis">underestimate</span> intelligence in older subjects.</p>
		<p>To overcome the cohort problems of cross-sectional studies, developmentalists began to use <span class="emphasis">longitudinal studies</span>, in which the same people are studied periodically over a span of time. These studies revealed a different developmental pattern for intelligence: Adults tended to show stable and even increasing intelligence test scores until their mid-30s, and in some cases up to their 50s. Then the scores began to decline (Bayley &amp; Oden, 1955).</p>
		<p>But let’s consider the drawbacks of longitudinal studies, too. People taking an intelligence test repeatedly may perform better because they become familiar—and comfortable—with the testing situation. Similarly, through repeated exposure to the same test, they may begin to remember some of the test items. Consequently, practice effects may account for the superior performance of people on longitudinal measures of intelligence as opposed to cross-sectional measures (Salthouse, 2009).</p>
		<p>It is also difficult for researchers using longitudinal studies to keep their samples intact. Participants may move away, decide they no longer want to participate, or become ill and die. Over time, the participants who remain may represent a healthier, more stable, and more psychologically positive group of people than those who are no longer part of the sample. If this is the case, longitudinal studies may <span class="emphasis">overestimate</span> intelligence in older subjects.</p>
		<p><span class="leadin">Crystallized and Fluid Intelligence.</span> Drawing conclusions about age-related changes in intelligence is challenging. For instance, many IQ tests include sections based on physical performance, such as arranging a group of blocks. These sections are timed and scored on the basis of how quickly an item is completed. If older people take longer on physical tasks—recall that reaction time slows with age—then their poorer performance on IQ tests may result from physical rather than cognitive changes.</p>
		<p>To complicate the issue further, many researchers believe there are two kinds of intelligence: fluid intelligence and crystallized intelligence. As we noted earlier, <a href="glossary.xhtml#key-fluidintelligence" target="_blank"><dfn title="fluidintelligence" class="keyword" data-original-title="fluidintelligence"><span class="selection_index"></span>fluid intelligence</dfn></a> reflects information processing capabilities, reasoning, and memory. To arrange a series of letters according to some rule or to memorize a set of numbers uses fluid intelligence. <a href="glossary.xhtml#key-crystallizedintelligence" target="_blank"><dfn title="crystallizedintelligence" class="keyword" data-original-title="crystallizedintelligence"><span class="selection_index"></span>Crystallized intelligence</dfn></a> is the information, skills, and strategies that people have accumulated through experience and that they can apply to solve problems. Someone who is solving a crossword puzzle or attempting to identify the murderer in a mystery story is using crystallized intelligence, relying on past experience as a resource.

		<p>Researchers once believed that fluid intelligence was largely determined by genetic factors, and crystallized intelligence by experiential, environmental factors. They later abandoned this distinction when they found that crystallized intelligence is determined in part by fluid intelligence. For instance, a person’s ability to solve a crossword puzzle (which involves crystallized intelligence) relies on that person’s proficiency with letters and patterns (a manifestation of fluid intelligence).</p>
		<p>When developmentalists examined the two kinds of intelligence separately, they discovered there are two answers to the question of whether intelligence declines with age: yes and no. Yes, because fluid intelligence does decline with age; no, because crystallized intelligence holds steady and can actually improve (Salthouse, Pink, &amp; Tucker-Drob, 2008; Deary, 2010; Ghisletta et al., 2012) (see <a class="xref" href="#figure8-5"><span class="label">Figure</span> <span class="number">8-5</span></a>).</p>

		<p>If we look at more specific types of intelligence, true age-related differences and developments begin to show up. According to developmental psychologist K. Warner Schaie, who has conducted extensive longitudinal research on adult intellectual development, we should consider many types of ability, such as spatial orientation, numeric ability, verbal ability, and so on, rather than the broad divisions of crystallized and fluid intelligence (Schaie, Willis, &amp; Pennak, 2005).</p>
		<p>Examined this way, the question of how intelligence changes in adulthood yields yet another, more specific, answer. Schaie has found that certain abilities, such as inductive reasoning, spatial orientation, perceptual speed, and verbal memory, begin to decline very gradually at around age 25 and continue to do so through old age. Numeric and verbal abilities show a different pattern. Numeric ability tends to increase until the mid-40s, is lower at age 60, and then remains steady. Verbal ability rises until the start of middle adulthood, around age 40, then stays fairly steady (Schaie et al., 2005).</p>
		<p>Why do these changes occur? One reason is that brain functioning begins to change in middle adulthood. For example, researchers have found that 20 genes that are vital to learning, memory, and mental flexibility begin to function less efficiently as early as age 40. Furthermore, as people age, the specific areas of their brains used to accomplish particular tasks changes. For instance, older adults use both brain hemispheres for tasks that in younger people involve just one hemisphere (Fling et al., 2011; Phillips, 2011; Bielak et al., 2013).</p>
		<p><span class="leadin">Reframing the Issue: What Is the Source of Competence During Middle Adulthood?</span>  It is during midlife that people come to hold some of the most important and powerful positions in society, despite gradual declines in certain cognitive abilities. How do we explain such continuing, even growing, competence?</p>
		<p>Psychologist Timothy Salthouse (1990, 1994a, 2010) suggests there are four reasons why this discrepancy exists. First, it is possible that typical measures of cognitive skills tap a different type of cognition than what is required to be successful in certain occupations. Recall the earlier discussion of practical intelligence, in which we found that traditional IQ tests fail to measure cognitive abilities that are related to occupational success. Perhaps we would find no discrepancy between intelligence and cognitive abilities in midlife if we used measures of practical intelligence rather than traditional IQ tests to assess intelligence.</p>
		<p>A second factor also relates to the measurement of IQ and occupational success. It is possible that the most successful middle-aged adults are not representative of midlife adults in general. It may be that only a small proportion of people are highly successful, and the rest, who experience only moderate or little success, have changed occupations, retired, or become sick and died. Highly successful people, then, may be an unrepresentative sample.</p>
		<p>Also, the degree of cognitive ability required for professional success may simply not be that high. According to this argument, people can succeed professionally and still be on the decline in certain cognitive abilities. In other words, they have brains to spare.</p>
		<p>Finally, it may be that older people are successful because they have developed specific kinds of expertise and particular competencies. Whereas IQ tests measure reactions to novel situations, occupational success may be influenced by very specific, well-practiced abilities. Consequently, middle-aged individuals may maintain and even expand the distinctive talents they need for professional accomplishment, despite a decline in overall intellectual skills. This explanation has generated research on expertise.</p>
		<aside class="marginalia marginalia_1">
			<p><span class="leadin">From the perspective of an educator:</span> How do you think the apparent  discrepancy between declining IQ scores and continuing cognitive competence  in middle adulthood would affect the learning ability of middle adults who  return to school?</p>
		</aside>
		<p>For example, developmental psychologists Paul Baltes and Margaret Baltes have studied a strategy called selective optimization with compensation. <a href="glossary.xhtml#key-selectiveoptimizationwithcompensation" target="_blank"><dfn title="selectiveoptimizationwithcompensation" class="keyword" data-original-title="selectiveoptimizationwithcompensation"><span class="selection_index"></span> Selective optimization with compensation</dfn></a> is the process people use in concentrating on particular skill areas to compensate for losses in other areas. Baltes suggests that cognitive development during middle and later adulthood is a mixture of growth and decline. As people begin to lose certain abilities, they advance in other areas by strengthening their skills. In so doing, they avoid showing any practical deterioration. Overall cognitive competence, then, remains stable and may even improve (Ebner, Freund, &amp; Baltes, 2006; Erber, 2010; Deary, 2012).</p>
		<p>For instance, recall that reaction time lengthens as people age. Because reaction time is a component of typing skill, we would expect that typists would slow as they age. This is not the case. Though their reaction time is increasing, older typists compensate by looking further ahead in the material as they type. Similarly, a business executive may be slower to recall names, but he may have a mental file of deals he has completed and be able to forge new agreements easily because of it.</p>
		<p>Selective optimization with compensation is one of several strategies adults use to maintain high performance.</p>

			<h1 class="title">The Development of Expertise: Separating Experts From Novices</h1>
		</header>
		<p>If you were ill and needed a diagnosis, would you rather visit a young physician fresh out of medical school, or a more experienced, middle-aged physician?</p>
		<p>If you chose the older physician, you probably assumed that he or she would have more expertise. <a href="glossary.xhtml#key-expertise" target="_blank"><dfn title="expertise" class="keyword" data-original-title="expertise"><span class="selection_index"></span>Expertise</dfn></a> is the skill or knowledge acquired in a particular area. More focused than broad intelligence, expertise develops as people devote attention and practice to a subject or skill and, in so doing, gain experience. For example, physicians become better at diagnosing the symptoms of a medical problem as they gain experience. A person who does a lot of cooking comes to know how a recipe will taste if certain modifications are made (Morita et al., 2008; Reuter et al., 2012).</p>
		<p>What separates the experts from the less skilled? While beginners use formal procedures and rules, often following them very strictly, experts rely on experience and intuition, and they often bend the rules. Their experience allows them to process information automatically. Experts often have trouble articulating how they draw conclusions; their solutions just seem right to them—and <span class="emphasis">are</span> likely to be right. Brain imaging studies show that experts use different neural pathways than novices to solve problems (Grabner, Neubauer, &amp; Stern, 2006).</p>

				<div class="caption">
					<p>Expertise develops as people become more experienced in a particular domain and are able to be flexible with procedures and rules.</p>
				</div>
			</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>Finally, experts develop better problem-solving strategies than nonexperts, and they’re more flexible in their approach. Experience provides them with alternative solutions to the same problem, increasing the probability of success (Willis, 1996; Clark, 1998; Arts, Gijselaers, &amp; Boshuizen, 2006; McGugin &amp; Tanaka, 2010).</p>
		<p>Not everyone develops an area of expertise in middle adulthood. Professional responsibilities, amount of leisure time, educational level, income, and marital status all affect the development of expertise.</p>

					<h1 class="title">What Is Multitasking Doing to Our Brains?</h1>
				</header>
				<p>Victor Norris’s home office looks like a lot like his teenage son’s room. He has three computer monitors on his desk—one for email and instant messaging, one for news and video streaming, and one for productivity software. Then there’s the television, the smart phone, and a video game console for relaxing. Victor switches from task to task all day long, often letting simple tasks such as writing an email drag on for hours because they keep getting interrupted. He’s so used to working this way that he doesn’t even realize he’s doing it.</p>
				<p> Victor Norris isn’t alone. The digital age has brought a wealth of gadgets providing instant access to information and is changing the way people work and socialize. Obsessive checking of email, text messages, and social networking sites is the new norm. But might all this frantic multitasking be changing the way people think? Research suggests that it does, and not necessarily in a good way.</p>
				<p> One researcher compared the performance of heavy multitaskers to non-multitaskers on a perceptual task. While seated at a computer, participants were flashed an image of red rectangles and then were shown the image again and asked whether any of the rectangles had changed position from the previous image. Then the task was complicated by addition of blue triangles, which the participants were instructed to ignore and continue performing the task exactly as before. But the heavy multitaskers just couldn’t ignore them, and their performance on the task worsened. Multitaksers also had significantly more difficulty switching from task to task when performing tasks in a series, and were less likely to use old but useful information to solve a new problem. The conclusion: Multitaskers may be oversensitive to incoming information (Ophir, Nass, &amp; Wagner, 2009).</p>
				<p>But it’s far from conclusive that multitasking technology usage is harmful. Other research shows that middleaged adults who have previous Internet searching experience show higher levels of brain activation while engaging in that task compared to merely reading pages of text, suggesting that new neural pathways are developed that are involved in decision making and reasoning. Furthermore, other studies show that people with considerable experience playing video games actually become better at reacting to stimuli, singling out important information, and switching between tasks (Small et al., 2009; Green et al., 2012).</p>
				<p>In short, we don’t know for sure whether multitasking is helpful or a hindrance in terms of quality of thinking. What is clear is that certain kinds of tasks are inherently difficult to carry out, such as driving and texting simultaneously: A considerable body of research shows that it can’t be done safely (Cook &amp; Jones, 2011; Long, Gillespie, &amp; Tanaka, 2012).</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Could it be the case that people who are prone to distraction are more likely to become multitaskers in the first place? Explain.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Are there any possible benefits to having difficulty tuning out irrelevant information?</p>

				<p>Terri Donovan, 50, raised five kids while working full time as an urban planner for the city of New York. “It was not a cushy job,” Terri says. “I raced about the city all day, and there were meetings almost every night. Zoning Board. Planning Board. I was lucky my husband Brian likes to cook.” Terri did her share of parenting, too. “I never missed a school play or band concert. I read the bedtime stories most nights. And we did everything together on the weekends, even the laundry.” Sometimes she felt she would “go nuts.” Yet, when her youngest child left home last year, she wandered around for 3 months, thinking “What next?”</p>

				<p>It was Brian who helped her figure out the answer. He booked a trip to Italy, their first real vacation in over a decade. “We went sightseeing and ate fabulous leisurely meals, but most of all we focused on being together.” Back home, she and Brian scheduled a weekly date night. “We finally have time for sex and long walks and Sunday brunch with the <span class="emphasis">New York Times</span>,” she says. Terri also started helping out one night a week at the local soup kitchen. “The people we serve have some interesting stories, and another way of looking at things. They’ve enriched my outlook.” The biggest change came when Terri decided to quit her job. “I wanted to help the people in my community,” she says. Now, she’s running for a seat in the state legislature. And her oldest daughter is pregnant. “When my kids left home, I realized they hadn’t been in the way of my life. They’d been the center of it,” Terri says. “So I’m looking forward to my grandchild—as long as my daughter and her family don’t move in.”</p>

			<p><span class="strong">Middle adulthood</span> is a time of significant transitions. Grown children leave home. People change the way they view their career. Sometimes, they change careers entirely as Terri did. Marriages undergo reevaluation. Often, couples find this a period of strengthened ties, as the “empty nest” leaves them free for uninterrupted intimacy. But sometimes they divorce. Middle age is also a period of deepening roots. Family and friends ascend in importance as career ambitions begin to take a backseat. And there is more time for leisure activities.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we first look at the physical changes of middle adulthood and how people cope with them. Then, we consider sexuality and menopause and debate the use of hormone replacement drugs for women. We also look at health issues that become of increasing concern in midlife.</p>

			<p>Next, we consider the changing intellectual abilities of middle-aged adults, and ask the question: Does intelligence decline over time? We investigate various types of intelligence and look at how each is affected by the aging process. We also look at memory. Finally, we look at social development and examine what changes and what remains stable over time in an adult’s personality. We consider the evidence for the so-called midlife crisis and discuss how family relationships change. We end by examining how people are spending their increased leisure time in middle age.</p>

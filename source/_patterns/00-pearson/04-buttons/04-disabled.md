title: Disabled Button
state: elements
---

Use a disabled button only if an action on the current screen can enable it (action possibility). A disabled button should only appear when contextually relevant. If the button is not needed for the task at hand, it should be hidden.

If a bank of 2 or more buttons is present but can only be enabled by direct action on the same screen, it can be hidden and only shown when enabled to give emphasis of new controls available to the user.
